description: Long before extended space travel became a reality, prolific science
  fiction author Murray Leinster created a richly detailed scenario in which a project
  that bears a striking resemblance to the International Space Station is being planned
  and executed. However, several nefarious factions want the planned expedition to
  fail. Can unlikely hero Joe Kenmore salvage the project?
